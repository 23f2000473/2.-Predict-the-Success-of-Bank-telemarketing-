Objective: Analysed direct marketing campaign data from a banking institution to predict customer subscription to term deposits ('yes' or 'no'). The campaigns relied on phone calls, often requiring multiple client contacts.
Data Preparation:
o	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and addressed missing values.
o	Engineered new features by combining existing ones and creating bins to enhance model performance.
o	Balanced the dataset using SMOTE and encoded categorical variables to prepare the data for modelling.
Modelling Approach:
o	Evaluated multiple models and selected XGBoost as the primary algorithm for its superior performance.
o	Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's accuracy and efficiency.
o	This project improved my expertise in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and implementing machine learning models for real-world problems.
